          <h3>About this policy</h3>
          <h4>Purpose</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of this privacy policy is to communicate clearly the personal information handling 
            practices we follow when we collect and deal with your personal information, including how you 
            can contact us if you wish to correct or access personal information we hold about you.
          </p>
          <h4>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</h4>
          <p>
            As a small business, we are exempted from the operation of the Privacy Act. However, protection of 
            your personal information that we collect is very important to us. This policy sets out how we 
            handle any personal information we collect or receive about you. <br>
            The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) can be viewed at 
            <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/" target="_blank">http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/</a>

          <h4>How is our privacy policy structured?</h4>
          <p>
            Our privacy policy is ‘layered’ as it is presented in three layers. The first layer is the Privacy 
            icon shown on the bottom of the web page in which we collect your personal information. It provides a 
            quick snapshot of our information handling practices. The second layer, the one page summary that you 
            reach from the icon link, provides you with a summary of how we collect, use, disclose and store your 
            personal information, how you can contact us and which Act applies to our activities. The third layer 
            is this full privacy policy that provides a more detailed explanation of our information handling procedures.
          </p>
          <h3>Our personal information handling practices</h3>
          <h4>What is personal information?</h4>
          <p>
            We use the definition of personal information contained in s 6(1) of the Privacy Act. It states 
            that personal information is 'information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming 
            part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an 
            individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion'.
          </p>
          <h4>Collection of personal information</h4>
          <p>
            We try to collect personal information directly from the individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            We only collect personal information for purposes which are directly related to our activities and 
            only when it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes. These purposes include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide you with information you have enquired about</li>
            <li>To provide you with goods you have purchased</li>
            <li>To provide you with services you have purchased</li>
            <li>When you ask to be on an email or mailing list so that we can send you information 
            about our activities and/or publications</li>
            <li>When you send us information about an event you are organising for 
            us to publicise on our website</li>
            <li>For normal communication processes when we might email you, text you or phone you</li>
          </ul>
